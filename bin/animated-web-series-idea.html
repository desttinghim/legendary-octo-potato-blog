<p>&lt;!--I'm going to make an animated web series about a giant robot knight in a science fantasy world. Would you be interested in watching that?--></p>
<h1>Animated Web Series Idea</h1>
<p>Alright, I'll admit it. I'm crazy. I want to make an animated web series mostly by myself.</p>
<p>Why? Because, that's why. Well, there is more but it's mostly because. One reason is that cartoons are awesome - they have some of the most interesting worlds in the land of TV shows and movies. They allow a great deal of flexibility in what content they have. Another reason is that I want to make some sort of story in some medium. And it needs to involve drawing so that I can improve my abilities.</p>
<p>At first I was going to write a novel but because I procrastinated too long, I ended up wanting to make a animation. I suffer from a condition called scale creep: if I don't buckle down and do something, I'll end up making the largest and most complex project I can. That's what's happened here, and I plan to make something before I end up trying to make a MMORPG.</p>
<p>So now that I've established that I'm making an animated web series and why, it's time for people to learn what its about. I've spent about four or five months now creating a world to set a story in. The basic premise is a science fiction/fantasy about a world where giant mechanical knights defend humans from demonic beasts. The knights are not perfect though, they rule oppressively, executing justice without a thought for mercy. In this story, a human tries to befriend one of these knights, who tries to ignore him.</p>
<p>That's the world and story in a nutshell. The world is a lot more complex than is being lot on here though. I've barely scratched the surface, though I might go more in depth in a later post. My main reason for posting about this here is to start a development blog, to help me work on it and let others get insight into my first attempts at cinematic animation. I also want to gauge how interested other people would be to see a free online animated web series. Would you watch it? Tell me in the comments below.</p>
