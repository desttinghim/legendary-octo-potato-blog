# Underwater Robot Adventure

Robotics is one of the coolest fields around. Well, according to me. I like to make things, and robots are some of the most fun things to make. It is no surprise then that I joined the ROV club at my school last year. For those that are not familiar with the term ROV, it means Remotely Operated Vehicle. Typically, these ROV's are underwater.
