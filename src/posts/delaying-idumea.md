# Delaying Idumea

I said recently that I would be updating Idumea weekly, and I hope to do that, but I seem to have run into a snag. The first problem is that I am not entirely happy with the first chapter yet. Its okay, but I don't think I did a great job fully explaining his motivations, or hinting that they were there. I don't think its quite believable that he would go through the portal. I plan to rework the chapter this week. I may not release it immediately though. This is because of a second problem; I don't have a backlog. This means if something comes up, I would miss an update (like this week). I dont want to make that a regular problem. So I'm taking a few weeks to get that set up. Sorry if this bugs anyone. I'm still learning! I have some other posts not related to Idumea in the works, so there will still be something. Expect a post about robotics soon. See ya!
