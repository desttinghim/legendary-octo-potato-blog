meta-title: I Begin Freelancing

At the beginning of summer, I wanted to get a job. My first thought was to become a freelance graphics artist. My second was to get a job at McDonald's. Being myself, I did neither. Instead I sat around and read fan fiction on the internet, watched videos on Youtube, and generally was a useless lump. I did plan on writing a novel and selling it, but I'm not nearly disciplined enough to get myself to finish.

Until a few weeks ago that is. My brother had been playing MineCraft, and someone on there was talking about how he needed a graphics artist for his video game. My brother told me about it knowing that I had wanted to start freelancing. I got in contact with him and sent a few examples of my work. He liked it! He sent me a list of graphics and I started working.

And that is how I began working as a freelance graphics artist! It's a been a week since then and I've mostly finished the graphics for it. It's a pretty great feeling for me to be making something and I hope I can keep it up. This was my first job and I'm pretty stoked that itÂ _wasn't_ fast food,

**[Vinny Mac](#2 "2014-08-31 05:00:24"):** I'm also a graphic designer and I've thought about doing freelance work myself. However I don't know where to find work. Where would be a good place to start?

**[Desttinghim](#3 "2014-08-31 18:48:26"):** Thanks for the reply! I plan on it.

**[Desttinghim](#4 "2014-08-31 18:51:30"):** I'm not entirely sure, as I said, I started making graphics for a person I met in a game. If you want to work on video game art I would recommend looking around at some of the forums for game making. Mostly, get to know people. Having connections helps, a lot. People are more willing to hire somebody they know a little and trust.
