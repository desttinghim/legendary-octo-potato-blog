[In a recent blog post ](https://desttinghim.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/starting-back-up/)I explained that I was going to be starting a web serial. That web serial is called Idumea. 

It's an adventure story set in a world called Idumea. Arthur, our typical teenage protagonist, becomes stuck there after going through a strange portal. There he finds a cruel Empire that is ruthlessly hunting down and executing people who are Changelings - unnatural people created by the Magi. He finds himself a victim of their witch-hunt and only survives when a group of Changelings rescues him. Stranded on a strange world he knows nothing about, Arthur tries to find his way home while combating powerful opponents; will he make it home?
