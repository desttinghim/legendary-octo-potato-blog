# Introduction

Hello! My name's Louis Pearson, but on the internet I prefer to be called by my screen name Desttinghim. I'm an artist of many mediums and a freelancer in some. I draw, animate, write and make games. Or at least, I want t. Most of my work is in drawing, but I hope to change that. In any case, welcome to my blog! Please enjoy!
