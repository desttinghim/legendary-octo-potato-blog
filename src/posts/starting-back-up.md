Alright, so I haven’t posted in a while and I haven’t pursued the goals I set in place. I never did start on that animation project, no matter how cool I thought it was.

I’m back now. I’m getting a little restless with the end of the school year (for me), and a realization of how close I am to graduating from High School. I only have a year left! I can’t speak for everyone, but the thought now terrifies me. There are so many classes I need to take to be ‘successful’ and such little time to do it. So much hinges on what’s happening now and in the next few months.

That’s why I’m beginning writing this blog again. My academic achievements aren’t the most impressive, and I only started extra curricular activities this year. Looking back, I see that there’s so much I could have done, but didn’t. That’s why I’m resolving to finish some projects, and get the ball rolling on ongoing ones.

The first project I’d like to get started on is blogging. This is mostly because I want to record more of my life. Currently I already keep a personal journal, but I want to share what I’ve done. There are some really cool things I’ve been able to be a part of, and I want others to know about it.

The second project I’d like to start is writing a story, or some sort of serial. Literature has been a huge influence on me throughout the years, and it would be a shame if I never contributed to it. With luck, I might even get somebody to read it!

Third, I’d like to make an awesome science/engineering project. For the past three years at my school, only one person has ever one. Not that that’s bad, he’s pretty amazing at science and engineering, but I’d like to win myself. I plan to design and build a robot using a smartphone that can navigate using the camera. It’s going to take a lot of electrical and programming expertise, and I think I can pull it off.

These are the projects I plan to start and hopefully finish. I’m a little terrified at the thought that I might not be able to finish any of these. But I have hope. I’ll get this done. Just watch me.
