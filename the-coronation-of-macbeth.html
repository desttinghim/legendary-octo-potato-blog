<p>I’m sure this isn’t what everybody (anybody?) was hoping for, but here’s a new post! This is an assignment I had for English – essentially writing fan fiction of the play Macbeth. This takes place during Macbeth’s Coronation and is from the point of view of the character Ross. As a warning, we never read the entire piece during class (and I never read all of it on my own), so some details may be inaccurate. If you would like to read this on Wattpad, go here.</p>
<p>For those that are still hoping for more of the story Idumea, I probably won’t finish it in the incarnation that is currently out. I felt like I had some problems with the world in that state, so I’ve yet again changed things. I do plan on participating in NaNoWriMo this year, so expect a bunch of updates during that time. See ya later! <img src="https://desttinghim.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/coronation_macbeth.png?w=660" alt="coronation_macbeth" /></p>
<hr />
<p>The sky was murky, black as pitch except for a brilliant full moon. Shivering, Ross and Lennox entered the castle of Scone, where Macbeth would be crowned.They took their seats just as the coronation was beginning.</p>
<p>It took an eternity to end for Ross. He was not interested in the coronation. He was still in tears on the inside, mourning the death of King Duncan. Outside, he was playing his part in the machinery of Scotland – life must go on, after all.</p>
<p>When it was over, it was time for the dinner. A magnificent spread was laid out, for sure! Breads, puddings, meat – anything you could name was there.</p>
<p>Ross wasn’t interested in the food though. Just as the King had been taken from this world, Ross’s appetite had been as well.</p>
<p>“Are you going to eat that?” Lennox asked, ever chipper. Ross pushed him his plate.</p>
<p>Eventually, Ross looked up. That’s when he saw the man with blood on his face, looking at him. His hands began to sweat. He breathed harder. He clenched his knife, preparing to fight.</p>
<p>The man looked away. Ross felt his tension melt away. Instead, curiosity began to burn through his veins. What would a man like that be doing here?</p>
<p>Looking around, he noticed that Macbeth was walking up to the man. What could he be doing? When Macbeth was close to the blood covered man, they began to converse in low voices. Ross strained his ear, trying to listen in. It was no use though – the men around him chatted to loudly. Instead, he watched.</p>
<p>For a few minutes, they conversed, until Lady Macbeth came up to them as well. At that point, the man left, leaving Lady Macbeth with her husband. She looked angry, and harshly whispered with him. Eventually, they both began back towards the table.</p>
<p>“I hope Banquo is absent out of rudeness, and not misfortune,” said Macbeth, “It would be a shame if something were to have happened to him.”</p>
<p>Lennox eagerly replied. “Don’t mind Banquo! Sit and eat this good food with us instead!”</p>
<p>Macbeth did not sit down. He looked around with a confused expression. “Where is my seat?” he asked. Lennox was confused as well.</p>
<p>Pointing to Macbeth’s empty chair, Lennox said “It is there, my lord. Can’t you see it?” Macbeth followed Lennox’s finger and paled.</p>
<p>“Which one of you has done this?!” he exclaimed, pointing at the chair. The lords fell silent and looked around. The chair was still empty.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” asked Ross, feeling lost. Macbeth whipped around.</p>
<p>“That, right there! Can’t you see it?” he cried. Ross stared at the chair intently but Macbeth’s meaning remained illusive to him..</p>
<p>“Gentlemen!” said Lady Macbeth, drawing all attention to herself. “Do not mind the king. He has had fits like this since his childhood. It will be over soon enough.” Then, turning to Macbeth she asked, “Are you a man?”</p>
<p>“Yes! But that which I see would appall even the devil himself!”</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous. Just take your seat.” she said. Macbeth ignored her, muttering to himself.</p>
<p>Ross was very lost, and a little scared. Macbeth was raving like a madman. He was as precarious as a teacup balanced atop a wooden pole in a windstorm. He didn’t want to be there any longer. “Perhaps we should all leave and give our king some privacy?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s quite alright. He’ll be over this soon enough. Just give me a little time to talk some sense into him” Lady Macbeth said. She was grinning unsettlingly, and her skin had a light sheen of sweat. Ross wasn’t calmed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Macbeth had stopped muttering. In fact, he had relaxed – he was almost joyful in his countenance. “”I’m alright everybody! The vision is gone – I have banished it from me. I propose we toast!” he said. There was a moment of silence as all sat still, confused. Tentatively, they all began to raise their cups. “To the king.” came the weak cry from the Lords, like little kids afraid of the dark. Macbeth took a sip, and they all followed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Macbeth let out a heart-stopping shriek. Cups clattered to the floor as Lords choked on their wine.</p>
<p>“Get out! Get out! Get back to your grave, you foul image!” screamed Macbeth.</p>
<p>“What is it now?”, said Lady Macbeth in an exasperated voice. For a few tense moments, Macbeth was silent. Then, he let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“Do not worry yourself any more. The vision is gone again.” he said. The lords shared doubtful looks. Lady Macbeth looked relieved. Ross was still curious though. What exactly had Macbeth seen that would make him say these things?</p>
<p>“What did you see, your majesty?” Lady Macbeth whipped around to look at him. Sweat covered her face as she forced a smile.</p>
<p>“I am going to have to ask you to leave. All of you. My king is not well, and your questions will only further his madness. Now go. Shoo!” she said nervously. Chairs scraped and groaned across the floor as the lords stood to escape the awful place. Ross bolted with the rest of them.</p>
<p>He would not be able to sate his curiosity. He and Lennox left as they had arrived, together. Eventually, Ross asked Lennox a question. “What do you think could be the cause of Macbeth’s distress?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” replied Lennox.</p>
<p>“Maybe, he is suffering from an affliction of the mind. Perhaps he feels guilty?”</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>“Murder. King Duncan was in his house when he was murdered. It must have been Macbeth that killed him.”</p>
<p>Lennox said nothing for a while. Eventually, he did speak up. “That that is possible. But to speak of such things would be treason.”</p>
<p>They both rode in silence after that. Ross was consumed by his thoughts. If Macbeth was the one to murder King Duncan, then he was a traitor and a fraud. He did not deserve anything he had. Ross spoke up again, “If he did do it, then what was that bloody man up to? I’m certain he killed someone else.” Lennox shrugged and shook his head. More silence.</p>
<p>That was until they heard hoof-beats off in the distance. Looking up, they saw a man on a horse. As he drew near, he shouted, “Someone has murdered the Thane of Lochaber! Pass it on to all you know. I am going to inform the king!” he said. The man quickly fell away into the distance.</p>
<p>Ross and Lennox looked at each other, shock on their faces. “Banquo. He murdered his closest friend.”</p>
