<p>On Saturday the 13th I was invited by a friend to go to the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry. I agreed to go, and we, as well as some other friends, went down to Chicago.</p>
<p>The museum is a really cool place to go. There are plenty of interesting things to look at and play with, more than can be covered in a single trip. I’ve previously been there and I still saw plenty that I didn’t see the last time I went there. There’s plenty I still haven’t seen.</p>
<p>Probably my favorite exhibit today was the Robots exhibit. There I got to see Baxter, a relatively cheap robot that’s designed to work alongside humans, as well as some soccer playing robots. However, what I found was the coolest part was a collection of cubelets. Cubelets are cubes that connect with each other, perform simple functions, and communicate. For example, one is a distance sensor, another is a wheel, and another one is a battery pack. When you put these together, you can make a robot that goes towards something when it’s close by. If you add in an inverter block, you make the robot move forward when it doesn’t see anything.</p>
<p>It’s a really cool concept that’s as addictive as legos, maybe even more so. I probably could have spent an entire day putting together blocks and pulling them apart. I would love to buy some, but they’re a bit pricey; about $30 for a single cube.</p>
<p>Another really cool exhibit was a mirror maze. For whatever reason it was put in an exhibit about math and how it’s everywhere around us, which was weird. We went through it a couple of times. It looks pretty amazing, like an endless room, and is really disorientating to walk through. It was impossible to find your way through with sight alone – it was practically required that you follow the wall or you would get lost. The next time I go, I plan to bring a laser pointer.</p>
<p>I also got to see a German U-boat. I don’t think I realized how massive submarines are until today. I also didn’t realize how big torpedoes are; they are massive. I can see how they’re able to sink ships so easily. I’m a little disappointed that I didn’t get to tour it though. Maybe next time?</p>
<p>After we were done with the museum, we all went to a pizza place and got some fabulous pizza. Hopefully I can go again.</p>
